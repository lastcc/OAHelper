# OAHelper
Long ago I wrote this software in an attempt to provide an efficient and effective way for work.

The OA system provided by our company in dealing with customers was low in speed, ineffiency. It was bulit in a different time, for a defferent web.

This software was orginally wrote to eliminate the latency and save the time of waiting. It also uses Jinjia2 to establish a built-in template renderer -- to automatically fill the necessaray infomation in the mail templates.

From today's perspective, I reckon that this software can only be a helper in that (I stopped development)it has a good deal of functionality not implemented.
